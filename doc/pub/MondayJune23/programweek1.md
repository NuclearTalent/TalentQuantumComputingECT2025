|                   | Several research teams in Trento are working in the field of quantum technologies, creating strong synergies and collaborations between groups at FBK, University of Trento, INFN-TIFPA and CNR, and with the support of the joint laboratory Q@TN. In this seminar, an overview of the quantum experimental platforms that are studied and developed in Trento will be given, with a focus on the field of superconducting quantum circuits. The development steps to build a superconducting device will be described, starting from design and simulations, followed by microfabrication and cryogenic measurements. FInally, examples of recent results in this field will be reviewed. | |
